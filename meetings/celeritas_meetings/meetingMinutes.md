Tom presented current budget situation.
FWP is in process and the current document is on Celeritas' General Slack channel.

Seth described the two milestones for current FWP:

- VecGeom GPU verification
- GPU performance demonstration of EM physics using a gdml geometry


Seth started a Rosetta Stone for nomenclature between Nuclear and HEP physics to
avoid confusion as we move forward. File is available on GitHub.

Krzysztof suggested talking to Soon Yung about CMS MC. Stefano will work on it.

FNAL has funding for Guilherme and Soon Yung to work full time on the project.

Philippe asked about the computing environment. Seth suggested keeping it open
and use spack.

For documentation we will use GitHub, at least for now.

Slides for the CERN Geant4 R&D meeting will be shared soon.
