# Fri Mar 20, 2020

Tom presented current budget situation.
FWP is in process and the current document is on Celeritas' General Slack channel.

Seth described the two milestones for current FWP:

- VecGeom GPU verification
- GPU performance demonstration of EM physics using a gdml geometry


Seth started a Rosetta Stone for nomenclature between Nuclear and HEP physics to
avoid confusion as we move forward. File is available on GitHub.

Krzysztof suggested talking to Soon Yung about CMS MC. Stefano will work on it.

FNAL has funding for Guilherme and Soon Yung to work full time on the project.

Philippe asked about the computing environment. Seth suggested keeping it open
and use spack.

For documentation we will use GitHub, at least for now.

Slides for the CERN Geant4 R&D meeting will be shared soon.



# Fri Mar 27, 2020

Discussed extension of celeritas requirement list:
- List is ample, but it is the needed equivalent information for HEP experiments.
- Description is very general, therefore Kevin Pedro may join the meeting next
  week to help clarifying the requirements.



CERN Geant4 R&D meeting:
- Team decided to aim for Apr 14 instead of Mar 31st.
- Focus of the talk so far is to present the team, describe the scope of the
project, and show openness to engage with the community.
- Slides will be sent around for appraisal.
